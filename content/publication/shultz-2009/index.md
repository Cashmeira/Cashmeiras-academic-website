abstract: Propionic acid (PPA) is a dietary short chain fatty acid and a metabolic
  end-product of enteric bacteria. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of PPA
  can result in brain and behavioral abnormalities in rats similar to those seen in
  humans suffering from autism. To evaluate cognition and sensorimotor ability in
  the PPA model, male Long-Evans hooded rats received ICV injection of PPA or control
  compounds prior to behavioral testing in water maze and beam tasks. Compared to
  controls, PPA-treated rats were impaired in the water maze task as indicated by
  an unusual pattern of mild or no impairment during spatial acquisition training,
  but marked impairment during spatial reversal training. PPA-treated rats were also
  impaired on the beam task. Neuropathological analysis from PPA-treated rats revealed
  an innate neuroinflammatory response. These findings add to evidence that PPA can
  change the brain and behavior in the laboratory rat consistent with symptoms of
  human autism. Crown Copyright Â© 2008.
