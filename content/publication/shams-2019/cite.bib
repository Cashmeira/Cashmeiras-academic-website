 abstract = {The role of the gut microbiome and its enteric metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has recently received increased attention. Of particular interest has been the SCFA, propionic acid (PPA). Several different rodent models have been developed using PPA treatment to examine behaviors of relevance to ASD. The effects of systemic (intraperitoneal, i.p.) administration of PPA on social behavior, anxiety-related behavior, and locomotor activity in juvenile male rats (age 35 days) were examined in this study. Rats received seven i.p. injections of buffered PPA (500 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline. Behavior was video-recorded during social interaction in a large open field (first four injections) or assessed in an automated activity system (individual animals, last three injections). PPA treatment significantly reduced social interaction, increased anxiety-related behavior, and produced hypoactivity and increased abnormal motor movements. These findings suggest that PPA alters behaviors of relevance to ASD in juvenile rats. These results contribute to the behavioral validity of the rodent model of ASD with systemic PPA treatment.},
