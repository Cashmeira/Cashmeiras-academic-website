abstract: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of neurodevelopmental disorders
  characterized by abnormal social interactions, impaired language, and stereotypic
  and repetitive behaviours. Among genetically susceptible subpopulations, gut and
  dietary influences may play a role in etiology. Propionic acid (PPA), produced by
  enteric gut bacteria, crosses both the gut-blood and the blood-brain barrier. Previous
  research has demonstrated that repeated intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusions
  of PPA in adult rats produce behavioural and neuropathological changes similar to
  those seen in ASD patients, including hyperactivity, stereotypy, and repetitive
  movements. The current study examined dose and time related changes of exploratory
  and repetitive behaviours with the use of the hole-board task. Adult male Long-Evans
  rats received ICV infusions twice a day, 4 h apart, of either buffered PPA (low
  dose 0.052 M or high dose 0.26 M, pH 7.5, 4 $Î¼$L/infusion) or phosphate buffered
  saline (PBS, 0.1 M) for 7 consecutive days. Locomotor activity and hole-poke behaviour
  were recorded daily in an automated open field apparatus (Versamax), equipped with
  16 open wells, for 30 min immediately after the second infusion. In a dose dependent
  manner PPA infused rats displayed significantly more locomotor activity, stereotypic
  behaviour and nose-pokes than PBS infused rats. Low-dose PPA animals showed locomotor
  activity levels similar to those of PBS animals at the start of the infusion schedule,
  but gradually increased to levels comparable to those of high-dose PPA animals by
  the end of the infusion schedule, demonstrating a dose and time dependent effect
  of the PPA treatments.
