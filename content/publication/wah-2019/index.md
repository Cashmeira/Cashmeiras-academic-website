abstract: It is becoming evident than the adolescent period is a sensitive period
  in stress response programming. Stressors during this time may alter signaling from
  the gut microbiome, which has been shown to increase the risk for psychiatric disorders.
  It was hypothesized that adolescent stressors may potentiate the symptoms of anxiety
  and sensory abnormalities induced by a gut bacterial product, the short-chain fatty
  acid, propionic acid (PPA). The present study investigated the effects of repeated
  predator odor exposure during early adolescence on male rats administered PPA in
  late adolescence and adulthood on a behavioral test battery. Male adolescent Long-Evans
  rats were repeatedly exposed to a worn or unworn cat collar stimulus in early adolescence
  on postnatal days (P) 28, P30, P32, and P34. They were administered either PPA (500
  mg/kg i.p.), or its vehicle in late adolescence on P40 and P43, and were subsequently
  tested on the light-dark anxiety task and acoustic startle task, respectively. In
  adulthood, the rats were again injected with PPA or its vehicle on P74 and P77,
  and subsequently tested on the light-dark apparatus and acoustic startle task, respectively.
  The repeated predator odor exposure was aversive and produced long-term anxiogenic
  effects as measured by the light-dark apparatus. PPA decreased activity and percent
  prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response, with its effects on vertical
  activity, a putative measure of escape behavior, being potentiated by prior predator
  stress. PPA's effects in adulthood were diminished in comparison to adolescence.
  These results suggest the importance of evaluating the effects of early adolescent
  stress on subsequent environmental insults on the development of behavioral abnormalities.
